# ðŸ‘‹ What

A GraphQL Server that curates our static `.json` Micro Front-end configuration files into an interactive API.

# ðŸ¤· Why

As our Micro Front-end inventory evolves and grows, our configuration data become richer yet commensurately harder to digest.

ðŸ’¡ _**Below a basic breakdown of our configuration files and their context:**_

## Global Configuration
`ep.global.config.json`

Registers Micro Front-ends and their corresponding environments and dependencies. 

## Builds Configuration
`ep.builds.config.json`

Stores a registry of deployed Micro Front-end builds to a specific environment _(**Test**, **Staging** or **Live**)_.

## Metadata **Configuration**
`ep.metadata.config.json`

A set of data bespoke to a single Micro Front-end build that has been deployed through our CI process.

# ðŸ‘€ Where

Our exponentially expanding Micro Front-end configuration surface area can be represented with the following scenario.

ðŸ’¡ _**Below a basic breakdown of our configuration files and their relationship to each other:**_

## Multiple Builds
Each Micro Front-end can "essentially" have an infinite number of builds.

## Multiple Environments
Our configuration data increases dramatically when orchestrating between multiple environments for a single Micro Front-end.

## Multiple Micro Front-ends
The total configuration surface area continues to grow substantially with each new Micro Front-end added to our architecture inventory.
